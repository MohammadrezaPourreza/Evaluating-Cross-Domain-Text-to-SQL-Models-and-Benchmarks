# Evaluating-Cross-Domain-Text-to-SQL-Models-and-Benchmarks

## Overview

This repository contains a curated set of SQL queries from the development sets of the Spider, Spider-dk, and BIRD benchmarks. These queries have been adapted for PostgreSQL, following the migration of the original databases from SQLite. This collection focuses on queries that are compliant with PostgreSQL syntax and conform to SQL standards.
